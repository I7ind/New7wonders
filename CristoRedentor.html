                <p> <h4> Christ the Redeemer </h4>
                    <br> The statue in Brazil, the most recently constructed of the 
                    new Seven Wonders, stands 125 feet tall. At the time the statue 
                    was commissioned by the Catholic Church in the early 20th century, 
                    over 90 percent of Brazilians were Catholic. 
                    In order for the statue, which weighs 1,145 tons, to support its 
                    massive arm span, it was made with reinforced concrete. It is 
                    considered the largest Art Deco sculpture in the world.
                    Its location, atop a 710-meter-tall mountain, has left it vulnerable 
                    to weather and damage from lightning. One of the greatest restoration 
                    challenges presented by the statue is matching the color of its six 
                    million stone tiles.
