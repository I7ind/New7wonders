                    <p> <h4> Chichén Itzá </h4>
                        <br> OVER TWO MILLION VISITORS IN 2016
                        Chichén Itzá was an ancient Maya city that eventually 
                        became part of the Maya-Toltec civilization. It flourished 
                        until around A.D. 1200, and later joined a political alliance 
                        with the cities of Mayapán and Uxmal. It had already been 
                        abandoned by the time the Spanish arrived in the 16th century. 
                        Archaeological excavations began in the early 19th century.
                        The ruins feature religious temples that epitomize Maya innovation 
                        in astronomy and science. The Temple of Kukulkán has 365 steps, one 
                        for each day in the Haab solar calendar. The temple is crowned 
                        by a carving of Kukulkán, also known as Quetzalcoatl, the feathered 
                        serpent deity.
